# AO CLI Catalog

`ao` is a thin CLI over the local AO daemon. Every command is `ao <command> --help` for the authoritative flag list.

| Command | What it does | When to use | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spawn` | Spawn a worker agent in a fresh git worktree | Starting a new task or issue | [commands/spawn.md](commands/spawn.md) |
| `session` | Manage agent sessions (list, kill, rename, restore, etc.) | Inspecting or controlling running/terminated sessions | [commands/session.md](commands/session.md) |
| `project` | Register, inspect, configure, or remove projects | Setting up or managing repos AO knows about | [commands/project.md](commands/project.md) |
| `orchestrator` | List orchestrator sessions | Viewing which sessions are orchestrators | [commands/orchestrator.md](commands/orchestrator.md) |
| `review` | Submit a reviewer result for a worker's PR | Completing a code review loop | [commands/review.md](commands/review.md) |
| `send` | Send a message to a running agent session | Correcting or directing a live agent | [commands/send.md](commands/send.md) |
| `preview` | Start a session-owned app or open an exact URL/file | Running and showing the worker's relevant app, Markdown, HTML, PDF, or image | [commands/preview.md](commands/preview.md) |
| `browser` | Inspect and control the session's shared live browser | Verifying a web app through snapshots, interactions, waits, screenshots, console, and errors | [commands/browser.md](commands/browser.md) |
| `start` | Fetch (if needed) and open the AO desktop app | Launching the app | [commands/start.md](commands/start.md) |
| `stop` | Stop the AO daemon | Shutting down AO | [commands/stop.md](commands/stop.md) |
| `status` | Show daemon status | Verifying the daemon is up and healthy | [commands/status.md](commands/status.md) |
| `doctor` | Run local health checks | Diagnosing AO setup problems | [commands/doctor.md](commands/doctor.md) |
| `import` | Import projects from a legacy AO install | Migrating from the old flat-file store | [commands/import.md](commands/import.md) |
| `version` | Print version information | Checking installed version | - |
| `completion` | Generate shell completion scripts | Setting up tab completion | - |

## Canonical executable

Inside AO-managed sessions, `ao` in this catalog is command notation. In actual
shell commands use `"$AO_CLI"` on POSIX (including Git Bash) or `& $env:AO_CLI`
in PowerShell. For example:

```sh
"$AO_CLI" browser snapshot
"$AO_CLI" preview README.md
"$AO_CLI" send --session <id> --message "Progress update"
```

```powershell
& $env:AO_CLI browser snapshot
```

AO supplies `AO_CLI` as its own absolute executable path. Do not replace it with
`which ao`, `command -v ao`, an npm shim, or a hard-coded application path.
Login-shell startup files can reorder PATH after AO pins it. If `AO_CLI` is
missing or no longer executable, report the failure; do not silently fall back
to bare `ao`. Run `"$AO_CLI" doctor` to diagnose a shadowing installation without
changing the user's shell configuration or deleting any installation.

## Conventions

- Most read commands accept `--json` for machine-readable output.
- `-p / --project` scopes session subcommand lookups to one project.
- Session and project ids are shown by `ao session ls` and `ao project ls`.
- `--agent` is an alias for `--harness` on `ao spawn`.
- Every command accepts `-h / --help` for the full flag list.
- For frontend launch, preview selection, or artifact handoff, read
  [commands/preview.md](commands/preview.md) before acting. Its static-file,
  project-runtime, and automatic-handoff rules are load-bearing.
- For page inspection, interaction, or request diagnosis, read
  [commands/browser.md](commands/browser.md). It defines shared-tab behavior
  and the opt-in network policy.

Use [references.md](references.md) only when a natural-language request does
not map clearly to a command above.
