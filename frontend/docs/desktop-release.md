# Desktop release architecture

Canonical desktop releases are conducted from the private
`Untrivial-ai/ao-releases` repository. That conductor is the only system allowed
to publish stable, nightly, or preview releases. The public
`Untrivial-ai/agent-orchestrator` repository supplies source and unsigned build
artifacts; it does not hold signing credentials or publish canonical releases.

Do not create release tags or try to publish from this repository. Operators
start and monitor releases in the private conductor, whose runbook contains the
authorized commands and recovery procedures.

## Release flow

At a high level, the conductor:

1. selects a public source commit and records its full SHA and release version;
2. dispatches `.github/workflows/build-artifacts.yml` in this repository with
   that pinned SHA and version;
3. downloads the resulting unsigned, short-lived workflow artifacts and
   `digests.json`, then verifies every artifact against the recorded digest;
4. performs signing, macOS notarization, packaging, and updater-feed generation
   in the private release repository;
5. uploads the complete release as a draft;
6. runs remote verification against the draft artifacts and feeds;
7. publishes the verified release atomically; and
8. updates Homebrew where the channel requires it.

Publication does not proceed when a digest, signature, notarization result,
feed, artifact set, or remote verification check differs from what the
conductor expects. A failed run is resumed or replaced from the conductor; it
is never bypassed by publishing directly from this repository.

## Public unsigned build boundary

`.github/workflows/build-artifacts.yml` remains intentionally dispatchable. It
accepts an explicit public ref/SHA and version, builds the four supported
desktop targets, and uploads unsigned workflow artifacts plus their SHA-256
digests. It has read-only repository permissions, does not use release signing
secrets, and does not create, edit, or publish GitHub Releases.

The private conductor pins the immutable source SHA before dispatch and treats
the returned digests as the handoff boundary. Signing credentials and release
publication permissions stay in `Untrivial-ai/ao-releases`.

Windows installers follow the same boundary (#4502): the NSIS maker
(`frontend/makers/maker-nsis.ts`) activates electron-builder code signing only
when signing credentials are present in the environment, so the public build
stays unsigned while the conductor signs with its own credentials downstream.

## Channels

- **Stable** releases are deliberate production cuts. After all verification
  gates pass, publication updates the stable updater feeds and the Homebrew
  distribution metadata.
- **Nightly** releases are conductor-scheduled builds from the configured public
  source line. They remain prereleases and update only nightly feeds.
- **Preview** releases are conductor-requested builds for an isolated candidate
  or change. They remain prereleases on their own preview channel and cannot
  replace stable or nightly feeds.

Version selection, channel naming, retention, and promotion policy belong to
the conductor. `frontend/package.json` may be stamped during an unsigned build,
but changing it in this repository is not a release trigger.

## Artifact verification

The conductor owns the authoritative verification and publication gates. For a
local diagnosis of a downloaded macOS artifact, use the repository's supported
verification script:

```bash
frontend/scripts/verify-mac-artifact.sh <artifact>
```

The script preserves the archive's code-signing metadata while extracting and
runs the expected signature, Gatekeeper, and notarization checks. Do not use a
plain `unzip` result to judge a macOS signature.

Stable macOS releases continue to include both a DMG for first installation and
a ZIP for electron-updater. The ZIP and `latest-mac.yml` must remain available:
electron-updater cannot install an update from a DMG. Nightly and preview
channels omit the first-install DMG.

## Isolated macOS differential v2 groundwork

Current AO uses full-ZIP macOS updates. It explicitly sets
`disableDifferentialDownload = true` before checks. The local rollout stop is
false and the v2 signing keyring is empty. Windows/Linux updater and feed
behavior is unchanged. No bridge release is part of this design.

Legacy macOS feeds permanently remain free of `blockMapSize`, blockmap or v2
references, and conventional `.zip.blockmap` assets. Old clients derive that
conventional suffix regardless of Developer Mode and may seed their next cache
cycle even after full fallback. Their discovery paths must remain empty.

The separately gated v2 resolver uses signed `ao-diff-v2-mac.json` and versioned
`.zip.aoblockmap` assets on the same GitHub release. Those names are never
requested by legacy clients. No public build/feed/publish hook generates them.
A future independently reviewed conductor change must verify exact signed
metadata and asset inventories without relaxing the legacy prohibition.

The v2 MacUpdater subclass uses the dependency's declared protected extension
and exclusively owned handles. Range failures, including 416, settle before
MacUpdater starts one full fallback. Stock 6.8.9's unsafe differential worker
is never invoked. Current AO remains on the stock full-only path.

See [the v2 protocol and acceptance contract](mac-differential-v2.md) for exact
schema, naming, signing, generation/verification, rollback and runtime limits.
The feature stays disabled and PR #4906 stays draft until real packaged macOS
acceptance proves reconstruction, fallback and native handoff. No conductor
mutation, publication or native-installation acceptance is claimed here.

## Incident rule

Exactly one publisher is a correctness requirement. If the conductor is
unavailable or a release is partially staged, stop and recover through the
private runbook. Do not dispatch a public publishing workflow, create a
substitute release, mutate an existing release, or publish from a second
identity.
